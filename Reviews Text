Review: "Wide assortment of hot dogs for under $6.
This place was hoppin' at the lunch hour! A few people looked like they were on lunch break from work, but most people seemed like they were trying it for the first time. I saw families, young adults, older folks. It definitely attracts all kinds of people!"
